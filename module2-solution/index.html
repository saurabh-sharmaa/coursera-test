            There has been an increasing clamour in the recent weeks for a detailed international investigation into the origins of the SARS-CoV-2 that wrecked havoc across the globe, affecting lives millions of lives and leading the world economy to a near standstill.

However, the initial response from China has been tepid, saying such a probe has no precedence or legal basis and investigations into such pandemics in the past have not provided any conclusive results.

China finally agreed to a probe after sixty-one countries asked for an “impartial, independent and comprehensive evaluation” of the WHO’s response to the covid-19 pandemic and the animal source of covid-19.

Putting across his case for a probe, Lawrence Sellin, a retired US Army Colonel “The fact that no natural source of COVID-19 has been identified, that scientific evidence exists suggesting bioengineering.

Portraying a brief history of scientific investigation that eventually led to Covid-19, Sellin writes, “There is ongoing censorship, even in the scientific literature, to restrict publication of information contrary to the accepted narrative that COVID-19 is naturally-occurring.”

            Come July, multiple experimental coronavirus vaccines will be subject to large-scale studies to find out whether they can really fend off the coronavirus, as the global vaccine race kicks up another notch. Moderna Inc, Chinese Sinovac Biotech and Oxford-AstraZeneca experimental vaccines are all expected to go into late-stage trials in the coming month.

What are its implications? implications? Take the case of the Moderna vaccine candidate, jointly developed by the US National Institute of Health (NIH) and Moderna Inc. Its primary test results in May were publicised as "highly promising". Healthy volunteers (a total of 45 in a safety trial), who each received two doses of the vaccine, made antibodies (proteins produced by the immune system to neutralise pathogens like virus and bacteria) that were then tested on human cells in the lab; those were able to stop the virus from replicating, which is a key requirement for an effective vaccine. The company said it has finished enrolling 300 younger adults in its second stage of testing, and has begun studying how older adults react to the vaccine. But, the virus has started tapering off in parts of the world.

            Amid the coronavirus pandemic, several countries across the world resorted to lockdowns to “flatten the curve” of the infection. These lockdowns meant confining millions of citizens to their homes, shutting down businesses and ceasing almost all economic activity. According to the International Monetary Fund (IMF), the global economy is expected to shrink by over 3 per cent in 2020 – the steepest slowdown since the Great Depression of the 1930s.

Now, as some countries lift restrictions and gradually restart their economies, here’s a look at how the pandemic has affected them and how they have coped.

How hard has the economy been hit?
The pandemic has pushed the global economy into a recession, which means the economy starts shrinking and growth stops.

In the US, Covid-19-related disruptions have led to millions filing for unemployment benefits. In April alone, the figures were at 20.5 million, and are expected to rise as the impact of the pandemic on the US labour market worsens. As per a Reuters report, since March 21, more than 36 million have filed for unemployment benefits, which is almost a quarter of the working-age population.
